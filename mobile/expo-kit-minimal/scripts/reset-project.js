An [Expo](https://expo.dev) app wired up to the Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter with
[\`@wallet-ui/react-native-kit\`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wallet-ui/react-native-kit).

Mobile Wallet Adapter is Android only, so connecting a wallet needs an Android device or emulator
with a wallet app installed.

## Getting started

\`\`\`bash
${pm} install
${pm} run android
\`\`\`

## What is wired up

- \`index.js\` installs the crypto polyfill, then hands off to \`expo-router\`.
- \`constants/app-config.ts\` holds the cluster the app talks to and the identity wallets show on
  approval. Change the cluster there to point somewhere else.
- \`components/app-providers.tsx\` sets up React Query and \`MobileWalletProvider\`.
- \`app/index.tsx\` is the home screen — empty, ready for your own code.

## Using the wallet

\`useMobileWallet()\` works anywhere below \`AppProviders\`:

\`\`\`tsx
import { useMobileWallet } from '@wallet-ui/react-native-kit'

const { account, chain, client, connect, disconnect, sendTransactions, signIn, signMessages } = useMobileWallet()
\`\`\`

\`account\` is \`null\` until a wallet is connected, and \`client.rpc\` is a
[\`@solana/kit\`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/kit) RPC client pointed at the cluster from
\`app-config.ts\`.

Every call that touches the wallet — \`connect\`, \`signIn\`, \`signMessages\`, \`sendTransactions\` —
launches the wallet app for the user to approve, and rejects if they decline.

## Scripts

\`\`\`bash
${pm} run dev      # start the dev server
${pm} run android  # build and run on a device or emulator
${pm} run test     # run the test suite
${pm} run ci       # type check, lint, format check, test, prebuild
\`\`\`
