# kit-expo-privy

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project pre-configured with [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/) for styling and Solana libraries.

## Technologies

- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/) (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- [@solana/kit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
- [@wallet-ui/react-native-kit](https://github.com/wallet-ui/wallet-ui)

## Set up Privy

1. Log in or sign up at the [Privy dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io).
2. On the [organization overview](https://dashboard.privy.io/organization-overview), click `New app`.
3. Enter your app name, select `Mobile app`, and click `Create app`.
4. Save the `App ID`, then click `Close`.
5. Under `User management` in the sidebar, go to `Authentication`.
6. In the `External wallets` card, enable `SVM (Solana) wallets`.
7. Go to `App settings` > `Clients`.
8. Set the app identifier to the `expo.android.package` value from `app.json`.
9. Save the `Client ID` for the default mobile app client.
10. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your-privy-app-id
EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID=your-privy-client-id
```

Do not put the Privy app secret in `.env`; this Expo app only uses public client-side Privy identifiers.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

This steps builds the dependencies for the development client.

```bash
npm run android
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in an Android development build:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)

This template requires native modules and Mobile Wallet Adapter support, so it does not support Expo Go or iOS simulator.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Test wallet connections

Follow the [Solana Mobile development setup](https://docs.solanamobile.com/get-started/development-setup) to configure a Seeker or Android emulator for testing Mobile Wallet Adapter flows. For emulator development, install the [Mock MWA Wallet](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mock-mwa-wallet.git) and open it once before connecting from this app.

If wallet connection fails with `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException` or `-1/authorization request declined`, make sure the emulator has a PIN or password set, then restart the mock wallet:

```bash
adb shell locksettings set-pin 1234
adb shell am force-stop com.solana.mwallet
```

Open the mock wallet again so it can create and persist its seed, then try connecting from this app.
